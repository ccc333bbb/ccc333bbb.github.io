      "description": "Munger believes that opportunity cost is the most important but most easily overlooked concept in economics. When you choose to do one thing, you are actually giving up the opportunity to do everything else. Truly smart people ask: 'If I choose this, what will I lose?' Munger always considers in investment decisions: 'If I don't invest in this, what will I invest in?' This way of thinking helps him avoid many investments that seem attractive but actually have high opportunity costs.",

When you master enough thinking models and repeatedly apply them in practice, your brain automatically internalizes these patterns, forming what we call 'intuition.' Munger emphasizes cultivating intuition based on rational analysis rather than blind feelings.",
