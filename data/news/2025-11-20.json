      "content": "In VS Code, GitHub Copilot Chat can access hundreds of tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that range from codebase analysis tools to Azure-specific utilities. But giving an agent too many tools doesn&rsquo;t always make it smarter. Sometimes it just makes it slower. If you&rsquo;ve ever seen this spinner in VS Code, you&rsquo;ve hit the limits of a model that&rsquo;s trying to reason across too many tools at once.

Instead of one general assistant, you can now build a team of specialists: a @docs-agent for technical writing, a @test-agent for quality assurance, and a @security-agent for security analysis. Each agents.md file acts as an agent persona, which you define with frontmatter and custom instructions. agents.md is where you define all the specifics: the agent&rsquo;s persona, the exact tech stack it should k",
