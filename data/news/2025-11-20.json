But giving an agent too many tools doesn&rsquo;t always make it smarter. Sometimes it just makes it slower. If you&rsquo;ve ever seen this spinner in VS Code, you&rsquo;ve hit the limits of a model that&rsquo;s trying to reason across too many tools at once.

Each agents.md file acts as an agent persona, which you define with frontmatter and custom instructions. agents.md is where you define all the specifics: the agent&rsquo;s persona, the exact tech stack it should k",
