Is that too light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams ( Sony’s new Inzone mouse is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games. ",
