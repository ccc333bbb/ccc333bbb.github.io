Blind spot monitoring, collision warnings, and emergency braking act like a second pair of eyes and ears, monitoring the car's environment to warn the driver, or possibly intervene, if a crash looks imminent. Other systems are better thought of as convenience features—things like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping , which relieve some of the burden of driving. Among the newer of these is the traffic jam assist.",
