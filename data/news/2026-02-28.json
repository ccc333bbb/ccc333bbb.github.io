A Paramount-WBD merger remains subject to regulatory approval, but it’s likely that we will see a Paramount-Skydance-Warner-Bros.-Discovery media giant. Such a conglomerate would unite two legacy media companies that have struggled with profitability for years and have strongly invested in streaming and cable. With Paramount inching closer to WBD ownership, let’s look",

Instead, it's a story about how superconductivity can be used as a test of some of the weirder consequences of quantum mechanics, one that involves non-existent particles of light that still act as if they exist. Researchers have found a way to get these virtual photons to influence the behavior of a superc",
