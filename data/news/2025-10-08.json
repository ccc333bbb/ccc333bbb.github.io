Companies have used them to build machines with dozens to hundreds of qubits, the error rates are coming down, and they've largely shifted from worrying about basic scientific problems to dealing with engineering challenges. Yet even at this apparently late date in the field's development, there are companies that are still developing entirely new qubit technologies, betting the company that they ha",
