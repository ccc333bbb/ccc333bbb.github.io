Instead of just… sweeping… I turned the supermarket into a grid graph and wrote a C++ optimizer using simulated annealing to find the “optimal” sweeping path. It worked perfectly. It also produced a path that no human could ever walk without losing their sanity. Way too many turns. Turns out optimizing for distance gives you a solution that’s technically correct and practically useless. Adding a penalty each time it made a s",
