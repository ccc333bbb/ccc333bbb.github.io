Their stance is that AI is flooding the industry with low-quality software, and we’re all going to pay for it later in outages, regressions, and technical debt. This argument sounds convincing until you look honestly at how software has actually been built for the last 20 years. The uncomfortable truth is that “slop” didn’t start with AI. In fact, it is AI that made it impossible to keep pretending otherwise. ",
