Reddit said that users \"shouldn't need to share personal information to participate in meaningful discussions,\" but that it will comply with the law by verifying age in a way that protects users' privacy. \"Using Reddit has never required disclosing your real world identity, and these updates don't change that,\" Reddit said.",
