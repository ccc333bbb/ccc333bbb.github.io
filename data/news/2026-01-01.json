Recently, I participated in a project with extremely strict latency requirements - a financial trading system. This system requires that 99.9% of request latency must be below 10ms, which made me re-examine the potential of web frameworks in latency optimization. Today I want to share practical latency optimization experience based on real project experience. ",
