There is a lot to like about the big Polestar, particularly the way it drives: sharp enough to give Porsche cause for concern. Among the handful of things I wasn't so keen on was its reluctance to drive slowly. Like a racehorse champing at the bit, the twin-motor Polestar 3 wanted to deliver lots of power with not much pedal travel, and it took a while, and some conscious effort, to adapt. ",
