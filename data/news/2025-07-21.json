This is where modular arithmetic helps: If prefixSum[j] % k == prefixSum[i] % k, then prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i] is divisible by k. 🔍 Approach (Prefix Sum + HashMap): Prefix Sum: Keep a running sum (prefixSum) while iterating through the array. Modulo Operation: For each prefix sum, compute mod = prefixSum % k. Normalization: ",
